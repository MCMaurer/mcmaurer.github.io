# Classes

## [R for Data Analysis & Visualization in Science (R-DAVIS)](https://mcmaurer.github.io/R-DAVIS-3.0/index.html)

In 2018 and 2019 I taught R-DAVIS, a required quarter-long course for the [UC Davis Graduate Group in Ecology](https://ecology.ucdavis.edu/). The course is based off of the [Data Carpentry R for Ecology lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/), but we've modified the content significantly over the years. The course covers git, GitHub, and R for data analysis and visualization. I created new lessons, maintained the website, developed assignments, and taught live-coding lectures. The course has been a big success, and attracts significant interest from other graduate groups.

The R-DAVIS course is ever-changing, and since it has been passed on to other graduate students, the link in the title of this section directs to the last version of the course I taught. The latest version of the course [can be found here](https://gge-ucd.github.io/R-DAVIS/).

## Gentle Intro to R and RStudio

In 2019 and 2020 I taught a quarter-long course on introductory R and RStudio skills for undergraduates in the [Research Scholars Program in Insect Biology](http://insectscholars.ucdavis.edu/). We covered similar content to the R-DAVIS course, without git and GitHub. Students completed a final project carrying out a simple analysis and visualization for an existing project in the lab the students are working in.

## Biosciences 2B: Introduction to Ecology and Evolution (Teaching Assistant)

I was a TA for the UC Davis BIS 2B course for several years. This position involved being the sole teacher for 2 lab sections per quarter, delivering lecture content, assisting students through lab procedures, and grading lab reports. I received a mean 4.75/5 rating from end-of-quarter student evaluations over 3 times teaching the course.
