    excerpt: "This is the most narrowly defined series I've ever worked on. Each photo here was taken with a Panasonic GX85 and a Cosmicar 22.5-90mm Television lens at 90mm and f1.5. The way this lens transforms views of everyday plants into exotic, even alien, landscapes gave rise to the name of the collection."

    title: "Subjectively Objective Submission"
    excerpt: "This is a series of images I submitted to [subjectively objective](https://subjectivelyobjective.com/)'s Investigations in Infrastructure book/gallery project. I had a photo accepted and published in the final book, [which you can buy here](https://subjectivelyobjective.com/product/investigations-in-infrastructure/). I think my submitted photos make for a small but cohesive collection in their own right."

As a photographer, I am particularly interested in the following topics: non-landscape nature photography, urban landscape photography, the fuzzy edges where manmade structures impose into nature and nature imposes back, and toilets. I strongly value composition over narrative focus, and I find joy in the feeling of a beautiful photograph arranging itself before my eyes as I move my feet. The world has a boundless ability to produce beauty, often in unexpected places, and my goal as a photographer is to discover and share that beauty.

I have had work featured in [Subjectively Objective](https://subjectivelyobjective.com/)'s books and gallery, and [Black Box Gallery](https://blackboxgallery.com/) in Portland.
