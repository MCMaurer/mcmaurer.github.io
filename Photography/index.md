    title: "backyard jungle"
    excerpt: "This is the most narrowly defined series I've ever worked on. Each photo here was taken with a Panasonic GX85 and a Cosmicar 22.5-90mm Television lens at 90mm and f1.5. The way this lens transforms views of everyday plants into exotic, even alien, landscapes gave rise to the name of the collection."

    title: "Subjectively Objective Submission"
    excerpt: "This is a series of images I submitted to [subjectively objective](https://subjectivelyobjective.com/)'s Investigations in Infrastructure book/gallery project. I had a photo accepted and published in the final book, [which you can buy here](https://subjectivelyobjective.com/product/investigations-in-infrastructure/). I think my submitted photos make for a small but cohesive collection in their own right."
