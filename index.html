excerpt: "I'm a data scientist at Metro Transit (MN), working on rider-facing data, particularly real-time bus and light rail predictions. 

<br>
<br>

I'm a behavioral ecologist by trade, and I did my PhD in Ecology at UC Davis with Jay Rosenheim and Sebastian Schreiber. 

<br>
<br>

You can read more about my work, view some of my photography galleries, or check out my blog for scattered thoughts on R and ecology."
